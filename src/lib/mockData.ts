### How to Build a Resume from Scratch

In this section, we‚Äôll show you how to effectively communicate your experiences to future employers.

### Progressive Notetaking

One of the best resume-writing habits is to track key events and outcomes as they happen.

Keep a running list of:
- What you contributed to
- Results you helped achieve
- Skills and lessons learned

If you haven‚Äôt tracked this yet, no worries ‚Äî the next step is **brainstorming**.

### Brainstorming

Brainstorming is essential, even if you‚Äôve already written resumes before. Spend 5‚Äì10 minutes per experience and write down everything you remember about it.

**Helpful prompts:**
- What did you do every day?
- Who did you interact with?
- What results did you help achieve?
- What skills/tools did you use?
- What materials can you refer to (emails, slides, docs)?
- Did you receive any awards or recognition?

### Activity: Brainstorming Through an Experience

Think about one experience you want to include on your resume.

- What tools you used
- Who you worked with

### Step 1: Pick What Matters
Focus on the strongest, most relevant items that show skills, results, or initiative.

### Step 2: Remove Repetition
Merge similar points and tighten language.

**Bad examples**:
- Coordinated logistics for event
- Organized event operations

**Better**:
- Coordinated logistics and operations for 200+ person gala, raising $5,000

### Step 3: Action + Impact Formula
- **Structure**: Action Verb + What You Did + Why It Mattered
- **Example**: Developed onboarding materials for 10+ interns, reducing ramp-up time by 30%
